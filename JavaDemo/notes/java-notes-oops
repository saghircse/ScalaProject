OOPs
1. Class and Object
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism - Overloading and Overriding
4. Abstraction
5. Encaptulation

Class and Object:
1. How to create objects?
2. How to instialize object?
	- Using reference variable
	- Using method
	- Using constructor
3. Constructor - 
	1. Default - Non Parameterized Constructor
	2. Parameterized Constructor
Rules :
1. Constructor must have same name as that of its class
2. No return type
3. Can not be abstract, static, final, and synchronized

=====================
Employee:
	id,name,salary,age
	display(), getAgeGroup()
	
=====================
Inheritance:
	- It is mechanism in which one class inherits/acquires all the states and behaviour of parent object.
	- IS-A relationship
Example : 
Developer is a Employee.
Manager is a Employee.

Why?
1. Code resubility - Child class can use properties of Parent Class
2. Method Overriding

Super Class --> Parent Class
Sub Class --> Child Class

class SuperClassX{
	// States and Behaviour of SuperClassA
}

class SubClassX extends SuperClassX{
	// States and Behaviour of SuperClassA
	// States and Behaviour of SubClassX
}
