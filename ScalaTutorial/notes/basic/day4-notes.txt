An Operator is used to perform an operation with one or more operand.

In Scala, operators are methods. Any method with a single parameter can be used as an infix operator. 
10 + 5  is same as 10.+(5)

Types of Operators
Arithmetic Operator (+, -, /, *, **, %)
Relational Operator ( ==, !=, >=, <=, <, > )
Assignment Operator ( =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc. )
Logical Operator (||, &&, !)
Bitwise Operator (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)

Decision making :
	IF statement
	IF-ELSE statement
	IF-ELSE IF…..ELSE ladder
	Nested IF-ELSE
	
Loop
	WHILE loop 
	DO WHILE loop
	FOR loop

Practical / Assignment:
1. Demo if else
2. Demo loop

Problems
1. Print numbers in a range
2. Print even or odd numbers in a range

Once you are confident with loop, then you can try out below:
1. Sum of numbers in a range
2. Factorial of a number
3. Fibbonacci Series
