==>Varibles
	val x1 = 4
	val x2 = 5
	val x3 = 7
	::::
	::::
	::::
	val x100 = 35
	
==>Array - 
Array 
 - Collection
 - Fixed size
 - elements of same type
 - Indexed ( starts with 0 )
 - Random Access using index
 - Mutable
	var ar = Array[Int](100)  ---OR,
	val ar = Array(4,5,10,30,35,....)
	How to access? => ar(0),ar(1)
	ar(2)=7 <--- it will replace 10
	
Disadvantage of Array
1. Fixed size : can not increase or decrease size of array once created
2. Insertion and deletion at middle or start of the array is very costly
 
==>Linked List - 
Linked List 
 - Similar to array but differeces are
	1. List is immutable
	2. List represnt a linked list where as arrays are flat
	
==> Map/JSON
JSON - {"Name":"Bern", "Loc":"Austria"} -- key-value pairs
==============================================

==> Collection : 
	1. List 	: List[T] is linked list of type T
	2. Set		: Holds unique elements
	3. Map		: Holds elements key-value pairs
	4. Tuple	: Tuple can hold elements of different types unlike array or list	
	5. Option	: Option[T] provides a container to hold zero or one element of type T.
	6. Iterator	: It is not a collection, but it is a way to access the ele of a collection one by one.
